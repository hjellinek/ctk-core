/**
 * Groups the JUnit TestSuites.
 *
 * <p>Each class here is a TestSuite for a specific (no wildard) set of test classes.</p>
 *
 * <h2>This is work in progress, still seeking an auto-gen mechanism to help</h2>
 * <p>There should be a Suite for each major IDL data type, and for infrastructure areas such
 * as serialization/deserialization, communications transport, or
 * launch/environment access.</p>
